This is a console app that collects insurance claims in a queue so you can deal with the oldest claim in the queue, you can also create a new claim and look as list of all the claims. When you start the app it will give you four options: see all claims, take care of next claim, enter a new claim and exit the app. If you enter 1 it will show you all of the claims inside of the queue. If you click 2 it will display the next claim in the queue and then ask if you would like to handle the next claim or not. If you hit "y" that claim will be removed from the queue since it has been handled. If you hit "n" that claim will stay in the queue and you will return to the main menu. if you hit 3 you can create a new claim and add it to the queue. If you hit 4 you will exit the app.
